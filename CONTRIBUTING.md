# Contributing

## System Requirements

Dotnet 8+ is recommended.

## Adding a project

1. Create a new library project under `src/`: `dotnet new classlib -o src/OpenFeature.Contrib.MyComponent`
2. Create a new test project under `test/`: `dotnet new xunit -o test/OpenFeature.Contrib.MyComponent.Test`
3. Add the library project to the solution: `dotnet sln DotnetSdkContrib.slnx add src/OpenFeature.Contrib.MyComponent/OpenFeature.Contrib.MyComponent.csproj`
4. Add the test project to the solution: `dotnet sln DotnetSdkContrib.slnx add test/OpenFeature.Contrib.MyComponent.Test/OpenFeature.Contrib.MyComponent.Test.csproj`
5. Add the desired properties to your library's `.csproj` file (see example below).
6. Remove all content besides the root element from your test project's `.csproj` file (all settings will be inherited).
7. Add the new library project to `release-please-config.json`.
8. Add a `version.txt` file to the root of your library with a version matching that in your new `.csproj` file, e.g. `0.0.1`.
9. If you care to release a pre `1.0.0` version, add the same version above to `.release-please-manifest.json`. Failing to do this will release a `1.0.0` initial release.

Sample `.csproj` file:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <PackageId>OpenFeature.Contrib.MyComponent</PackageId>
    <VersionNumber>0.0.1</VersionNumber> <!--x-release-please-version -->
    <VersionPrefix>$(VersionNumber)</VersionPrefix>
    <AssemblyVersion>$(VersionNumber)</AssemblyVersion>
    <FileVersion>$(VersionNumber)</FileVersion>
    <Description>A very valuable OpenFeature contribution!</Description>
    <Authors>Me!</Authors>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

## Documentation

Any published modules must have documentation in their root directory, explaining the basic purpose of the module as well as installation and usage instructions.
Instructions for how to develop a module should also be included (required system dependencies, instructions for testing locally, etc).

## Testing

Any published modules must have reasonable test coverage.
The instructions above will generate a test project for you.

Use `dotnet test` to test the entire project.

### Running End-to-End (E2E) Integration Tests

To run the E2E integration tests for this repository, you need to set up your development environment as follows:

#### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: You must have Docker installed and running on your machine. You can use [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or install Docker on Linux/Mac OS. The E2E tests require Docker to spin up test containers.

#### Configuration

Each E2E test project contains an `appsettings.json` file. To enable E2E tests, ensure the following setting is present and set to `true`:

```json
{
  "E2E": "true"
}
```

You can also set the `E2E` environment variable to `true` if you prefer not to modify the `appsettings.json` file.

An example E2E project are the Flagd Provider E2E tests, found [here](/test/OpenFeature.Contrib.Providers.Flagd.E2e.ProcessTest/appsettings.json).

If you want to disable E2E tests, set `"E2E": "false"` or remove the setting.

> **Note:** The E2E tests will be skipped if Docker is not running or if the `E2E` setting is not enabled in `appsettings.json`.

## Automated Changelog

Each time a release is published the changelogs will be generated automatically using [googleapis/release-please-action](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action). The tool will organise the changes based on the PR labels.
Please make sure you follow the latest [conventions](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). We use an automation to check if the pull request respects the desired conventions. You can check it [here](https://github.com/open-feature/dotnet-sdk/actions/workflows/lint-pr.yml). Must be one of the following:

-   build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: nuget)
-   ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: GitHub Actions, Coverage)
-   docs: Documentation only changes
-   feat: A new feature
-   fix: A bug fix
-   perf: A code change that improves performance
-   refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
-   style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
-   test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

If you want to point out a breaking change, you should use `!` after the type. For example: `feat!: excellent new feature`.

### Changelog Visibility and Release Triggers

Only certain types are visible in the generated changelog:

-   `feat`: ‚ú® New Features - New functionality added
-   `fix`: üêõ Bug Fixes - Bug fixes and corrections
-   `perf`: üöÄ Performance - Performance improvements
-   `refactor`: üîß Refactoring - Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
-   `revert`: üîô Reverts - Reverted changes

## Dependencies

Keep dependencies to a minimum.
Dependencies used only for building and testing should have a `<PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>` element to prevent them from being exposed to consumers.

## Consuming pre-release packages

1. Acquire a [GitHub personal access token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) scoped for `read:packages` and verify the permissions:

    ```console
    $ gh auth login --scopes read:packages

    ? What account do you want to log into? GitHub.com
    ? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations? HTTPS
    ? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? Login with a web browser

    ! First copy your one-time code: ****-****
    Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...

    ‚úì Authentication complete.
    - gh config set -h github.com git_protocol https
    ‚úì Configured git protocol
    ‚úì Logged in as ********
    ```

    ```console
    $ gh auth status

    github.com
      ‚úì Logged in to github.com as ******** (~/.config/gh/hosts.yml)
      ‚úì Git operations for github.com configured to use https protocol.
      ‚úì Token: gho_************************************
      ‚úì Token scopes: gist, read:org, read:packages, repo, workflow
    ```

2. Run the following command to configure your local environment to consume packages from GitHub Packages:

    ```console
    $ dotnet nuget update source github-open-feature --username $(gh api user --jq .email) --password $(gh auth token) --store-password-in-clear-text

    Package source "github-open-feature" was successfully updated.
    ```
